Usage: check_please <reference> <candidate> [FLAGS]

  Tool for parsing and diffing two JSON documents.

  Arguments:
    <reference> is the name of a file to use as, well, the reference.
    <candidate> is the name of a file to compare against the reference.

    NOTE: If you have a utility like MacOS's `pbpaste`, you MAY omit
    the <candidate> arg, and pipe the second document instead, like:

      $ pbpaste | check_please <reference>

  FLAGS:
    -f, --format FORMAT              Format in which to present diffs.
                                       (Allowed values: [json, table])
    -n, --max-diffs MAX_DIFFS        Stop after encountering a specified number of diffs.
        --fail-fast                  Stop after encountering the first diff.
                                       (equivalent to '--max-diffs 1')
    -d, --max_depth MAX_DEPTH        Limit the number of levels to descend when comparing documents.
                                       (NOTE: root has depth = 1)
    -s, --select-paths PATH_EXPR     ONLY record diffs matching the provided PATH expression.
                                       May be repeated; values will be treated as an 'OR' list.
                                       Can't be combined with --reject-paths.
    -r, --reject-paths PATH_EXPR     DON'T record diffs matching the provided PATH expression.
                                       May be repeated; values will be treated as an 'OR' list.
                                       Can't be combined with --select-paths.
        --match-by-key FOO           Specify how to match reference/candidate pairs in arrays of hashes.
                                       May be repeated; values will be treated as an 'OR' list.
                                       See the README for details on how to actually use this.
                                       NOTE: this does not yet handle non-string keys.
